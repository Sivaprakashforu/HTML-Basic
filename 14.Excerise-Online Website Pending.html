        <h3>Do you want to gain inspiration from the best personal websites?</h3>
        
        <p>That’s when this collection comes into play.<br><br>
        From simple and minimalist layouts to creative and colorful ones, we included something for everyone.<br><br>

        We also added the platform the website was built on, so you can use the same one for yours.</p>

        <p>However, you can also pick any other personal website builder alternative or even opt for a personal WordPress theme.<br><br>

        With all the options available and ready to go, check these beautiful responsive web designs first and take action in building your site second.</p>

        <h2>Best Personal Websites & Design Ideas</h2>

            <h3><li><a href="https://www.petermckinnon.com/">Peter McKinnon</a></li></h3>
            
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Built with: <a href="https://colorlib.com/go/squarespace">Squarespace</a></p>
            
            <p>Like Lin-Manuel, Peter McKinnon also uses an image of himself above the fold but keeps things even more minimalist.<br><br>

            His entire home page is a beautiful collage of images with a parallax effect that enhances the viewing experience.<br><br>

            Finally, the clean footer only features social icons to stick to the minimalist formatting.<br><br>

            Note: If you’re a content creator, showcase some of your works on your website.</p>
            
            <h3><li><a href="https://www.jencarrington.com/">Jen Carrington</a></li></h3>
            
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Built with: <a href="https://colorlib.com/go/squarespace">Squarespace</a></p>
            
            <p>Jen Carrington’s page is modern, with a feminine touch and great storytelling. The header is basic, and the footer only includes a few links, keeping things minimalist.<br><br>

            Jen expresses herself well through her <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/clean-websites/">clean website</a>, giving you the feeling you know her. Another unique feature is the quiz which increases the likelihood of scoring more high-quality leads.<br><br>

            <strong>Note</strong>: Instead of using a simple subscription form, make it more engaging with a quiz.</p>
            
            <h3><li><a href="https://www.kantwon.com/">Kantwon</a></li></h3>
            
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Built with: <a href="https://colorlib.com/go/squarespace">Squarespace</a></p>
            
            <p>There’s one main thing about Kantwon that makes it different than any other personal website on this list: It’s FUN!<br><br>

            From the headshot above the fold to using a lot of emojis, cool images and vibrant colors, Kantwon’s page has a lot of life in it.<br><br>

            And while the page is very long, it doesn’t feel boring when you scroll it. Moreover, the header and the footer only have social media icons, no links, no menu, no search bar.<br><br>

            <strong>Note</strong>: Make a one-page website that’s fun, exciting and scrollable.<br><br>
